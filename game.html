                    <h3>I PRESENT TO THEE:</h3>
                    <h4>THE RULES OF PIG_DICE</h4>
                    <p>Whether you are stuck in a waiting room, needing entertainment at a restaurant, or looking for a
                        simple game to play while on vacation, Pig is the perfect way to pass the time with family. And
                        all you need is one six-sided die and a way to keep score.</p>
                    <p>Pig is considered a jeopardy game, where you risk everything to see if you can win more. The
                        numbers on the die (except for "1") each represent points that can accumulate—the winner is the
                        first player to reach 100 points. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Number of Players</h2>
                    <p>The game of Pig is best with two players, but it can work with more people. Just keep in mind
                        that the downtime between turns grows longer with each additional player, which could be
                        challenging for the little ones.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                    <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as
                        possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's
                        turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1
                        doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that
                        particular roll.</p>
                    <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
                        rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of
                        the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>
                    <p>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Scoring Examples</h2>
                    <p>Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig:</p>
                    <p>Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue rolling. She rolls seven more times, getting
                        a 6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, and then 1. Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn is over and she earns 0
                        points for this turn.</p>
                    <p>Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times,
                        getting a 3, 4, 2, and 6. He decides to hold (and not take a chance of getting a 1). Craig earns
                        21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6 = 21).</p>

                    <h3>I PRESENT TO THEE:</h3>
                    <h4>THE HISTORY OF PIG_DICE</h4>
                    <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of
                        folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass
                        the Pigs, Pig Dice, and Skunk. Pig is commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability
                        concepts.</p>
                    <p>Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For
                        jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous
                        gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided
                        into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games,
                        the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic
                        Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal
                        score without exceeding it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>CONTEMPORARY PIG_DICE IN TEACHING</h2>
                    <p>Pig is a folk jeopardy dice game described by John Scarne in 1945, and was an ancestor of the
                        modern game Pass the Pigs® (originally called PigMania®).</p>
                    <p>Pig often serves as a simple example for teaching probability concepts from the middle school
                        level upwards. The game also provides exercises for teaching Computer Science in areas ranging
                        from introductory courses to advanced machine learning material.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF CONTEMPORARY PIG_DICE</h2>
                    <h5>1)Skunk</h5>
                    <p>Skunk (or Think) is a variation of Two-Dice Pig that is played with large groups.</p>
                    <p>Rather than rolling in turn, all players begin the round standing. At any point in the round, a
                        player may hold by sitting down. The round continues until a 1 is rolled, or all players have
                        sat down. Skunk is played in five rounds, and scoring is recorded in a 5-column table with
                        columns labeled with the letters of the word "SKUNK". The first round score is entered in the
                        "S"-column, the next in the first "K"-column, and so on. After five rounds, the highest-scoring
                        player is the winner.</p>
                    <h5>2)Two-Dice Pig</h5>
                    <p>This variation is the same as Pig, except:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
                        </li>
                        <li>If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.</li>
                        <li>If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.</li>
                        <li>If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the
                            player is obligated to roll again (possible sub-variation of the two-dice game.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>3)Big Pig</h5>
                    <p>This variation is the same as Two-Dice Pig, except:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If two 1s are rolled, the player adds 25 to the turn total.</li>
                        <li>If other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the value of the dice to the turn total.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

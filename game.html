                    <h3>I PRESENT TO THEE:</h3>
                    <h4>THE RULES OF PIG_DICE</h4>
                    <p>Whether you are stuck in a waiting room, needing entertainment at a restaurant, or looking for a
                        simple game to play while on vacation, Pig is the perfect way to pass the time with family. And
                        all you need is one six-sided die and a way to keep score.</p>
                    <p>Pig is considered a jeopardy game, where you risk everything to see if you can win more. The
                        numbers on the die (except for "1") each represent points that can accumulateâ€”the winner is the
                        first player to reach 100 points. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Number of Players</h2>
                    <p>The game of Pig is best with two players, but it can work with more people. Just keep in mind
                        that the downtime between turns grows longer with each additional player, which could be
                        challenging for the little ones.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
                    <p>On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as
                        possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die. However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's
                        turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited. Rolling a 1
                        doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total earned during that
                        particular roll.</p>
                    <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
                        rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of
                        the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>
                    <p>When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Scoring Examples</h2>
                    <p>Here are two examples of how to keep score in Pig:</p>
                    <p>Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue rolling. She rolls seven more times, getting
                        a 6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, and then 1. Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn is over and she earns 0
                        points for this turn.</p>
                    <p>Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times,
                        getting a 3, 4, 2, and 6. He decides to hold (and not take a chance of getting a 1). Craig earns
                        21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6 = 21).</p>
